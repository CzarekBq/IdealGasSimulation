# IdealGasSimulation
Ideal Gas Simulation was created in jupyter notebook for my first year programming course in Python. Everything from graphics in PyGame to dynamics of the particles were done by me using basic math and geometry as well as tools available for displaying the simulated particles.

This simplistic simulation is a nice way of showing us how even the most idealized models can teach us a lot about our real world.
